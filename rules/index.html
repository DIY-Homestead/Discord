          <li>Be respectful to fellow posters – name-calling, rudeness, and trolling are not welcome here.</li>
          <li>Do not ask for or give any personal information on anyone in a public channel, same rules as reddit apply.</li>
          <li>Keep chat clean, no NSFW/porn.</li>
          <li>Do not spam for ranks. Spammers will be deranked and banned.</li>
          <li>Only use bot commands in #bots. Repeated failure to do so may result in a kick.</li>
          <li>Emojis in usernames will be removed.</li>
          <li>You may be banned at any time for hookup requests or blatant trolling.</li>
          <li>Be civil and friendly above all else.</li>

        <h3 class="uk-text-center">Roles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Each time you post a message you get a random number of XP between 15 and 25.</li>
          <li>To avoid flood, you can only gain xp once per minute. In the server, you can type !rank or !levels to get your rank or see leaderboards.</li>
          <li>Level 0: Everyone starts at level zero, you should be able to comment in #general.</li>
          <li>The admins are working to bring a fun reward system for gaining levels. Higher levels will have access to secret channels and other goodies. Stay tuned</li>
          <li>We may expand other levels and roles as needed.</li>
          <li>Vanity roles like ‘Homesteader’, ‘Urban Homesteader’ and ‘Enthusiast’, can be self-assigned by typing exactly <code>/homesteader</code> or <code>/enthusiast</code> in #bots. If you have any problems assigning yourself a role, feel free to ping
            the admins.</li>
